    "To celebrate the Lunar New Year of the Rat, Douglas decides to count the number of rats living in his area. It is impossible for him to find all rats, as they tend to be well hidden. However, on the first day of the new year, Douglas manages to capture n1 rats, and marks each of them with an ear tag before releasing them. On the second day of the new year, Douglas captures n2 rats, and observes that n12 of them had been marked during the first day.\n",
